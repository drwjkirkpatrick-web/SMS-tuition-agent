## Efficiency (10)

### E1. Bulk Guardian Loading in Reminder Worker
**Prompt:** The reminder worker (`workers/reminders.py`) loads guardians one-by-one inside a loop (`select(Guardian).where(Guardian.id == candidate.guardian_id)`). Refactor to bulk-load all guardians for the batch of candidates in a single query using `Guardian.id.in_([list of IDs])`. Return a dict mapping `guardian_id → Guardian` for O(1) lookup. Test: verify the same candidates are produced with the bulk approach vs. the per-row approach.

### E2. Accurate Insert/Duplicate Counting in DispatchService
**Prompt:** `DispatchService.insert_outbox_messages()` always returns `{"inserted": len(values), "duplicates_skipped": 0}` — it can't distinguish inserts from conflicts. Use `session.execute(stmt)` and inspect `result.rowcount` or use `insert(...).on_conflict_do_nothing().returning(OutboundMessage.id)` to get the actual count of inserted rows. Compute `duplicates_skipped = len(values) - actual_inserted`. Test: insert 3 candidates, re-insert same 3, verify second call returns `inserted=0, duplicates_skipped=3`.

### E3. Use TemplateRenderer in Send Worker
**Prompt:** `workers/sends.py::_render_body()` has hardcoded template strings that duplicate `domain/templates.py`. Replace `_render_body` with a call to `TemplateRenderer.render()`, loading guardian name, student name, school name, amount, and due date from the DB. Test: verify a DUE_14 message renders with the actual school name and student first name.

### E4. Twilio Delivery Query by SID Instead of Body Scan
**Prompt:** `TwilioAdapter.query_delivery()` lists 100 recent messages and scans `msg.body` for `client_message_id` — O(N) and unreliable. Refactor to query by `provider_message_id` (the stored Twilio SID) using `self.client.messages(sid).fetch()`. Update the reconciliation worker to pass `message.provider_message_id` instead of `message.client_message_id`. Test: mock `client.messages(sid).fetch()` and verify the adapter returns the correct status.

### E5. Single GROUP BY Query for Dashboard Stats
**Prompt:** `api/admin.py::dashboard_stats()` runs a separate `COUNT(*)` query for each `MessageStatus` and `InvoiceStatus` enum value — 15+ queries. Refactor to a single `SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM outbound_messages WHERE school_id=:id GROUP BY status` and similarly for invoices. Test: verify the returned dict matches the per-status approach.

### E6. Cache School Reminder Policy in Redis
**Prompt:** `PolicyService.load_policy()` hits the database every time the scheduler runs. Cache the policy in Redis with a 5-minute TTL, keyed by `school:{id}:policy`. Invalidate on `save_policy()`. Test: call `load_policy()` twice, verify the second call hits Redis (mock `redis_client.get`).

### E7. Worker DB Connection Pool Sizing
**Prompt:** `infra/database.py` uses `pool_size=5, max_overflow=0` for all services. Workers need more connections when scaled (e.g., 3 workers × 2 concurrency = 6 concurrent sessions). Add `DATABASE_POOL_SIZE` and `DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW` env vars with sensible defaults (5/10 for API, 10/20 for workers). Test: verify settings load custom pool sizes and the engine is created with them.

### E8. Batch Outbox Polling with JOIN for Guardian Phone
**Prompt:** `workers/sends.py` loads guardian phone per-message with a separate query. Refactor `OutboxService.poll_pending()` to JOIN guardian data in the initial query (eager load `Guardian.phone`). Test: verify the polled messages include guardian phone numbers without a second query round-trip.

### E9. Index Optimization for Common Query Patterns
**Prompt:** Several high-frequency queries lack covering indexes: (1) `outbound_messages` WHERE `status='pending' AND retry_count < max_retries` — add a partial index on `(retry_count, max_retries)` WHERE `status='pending'`. (2) `invoices` WHERE `school_id=X AND status IN (pending, partial) AND due_date < Y` — add a composite index on `(school_id, status, due_date)`. (3) `inbound_messages` WHERE `school_id=X AND intent='call' AND processed_at IS NULL` — add partial index. Write a new Alembic migration. Test: migration applies cleanly and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` shows index usage.

### E10. Celery Task Time Limits and Soft Limits
**Prompt:** No Celery task has a time limit. A hung Twilio API call can block a worker indefinitely. Add `task_time_limit=300` (hard kill after 5 min) and `task_soft_time_limit=240` (soft timeout raises `SoftTimeLimitExceeded` after 4 min) to `celery_app.conf`. Add per-task overrides for long-running tasks. Test: verify a task that sleeps 10s with `task_time_limit=2` raises `TimeLimitExceeded`.

## Security (10)

### S1. Rate Limiting on Admin API Endpoints
**Prompt:** The admin API has no rate limiting — an attacker with a valid token can flood requests. Add a Redis-backed rate limiter middleware: 60 requests/minute per IP for admin endpoints. Return 429 with `Retry-After` header when exceeded. Test: make 61 requests in 1 second, verify the 61st returns 429.

### S2. Enforce Admin Token Configuration at Startup
**Prompt:** `Settings.admin_token_hash` defaults to `None`. If not set, admin endpoints return 501 but the app starts silently. Add a validation check in the FastAPI lifespan: if `app_env == "production"` and `admin_token_hash` is None, refuse to start. Test: set `app_env=production` without `admin_token_hash`, verify `RuntimeError` is raised.

### S3. Twilio Webhook Signature — Full Algorithm
**Prompt:** `TwilioAdapter._compute_signature()` concatenates `url + body`, but Twilio's actual algorithm sorts form parameters alphabetically and concatenates `url + key + value` for each. Implement the correct algorithm: parse the form body, sort by key, build the signature string as `url + key1 + value1 + key2 + value2...`. Test: use Twilio's documented test vector to verify signature correctness.

### S4. Input Sanitization for Inbound SMS Bodies
**Prompt:** Inbound SMS bodies are stored raw in the database and used in audit logs. A malicious SMS could contain SQL injection payloads or log injection (newlines, control characters). Sanitize on storage: strip control characters (except newline/tab), cap at 1600 chars, and escape for log output. Test: send a body with `\x00` and `\n\nFAKE LOG LINE`, verify stored body has no null bytes and log entry is single-line.

### S5. Remove Hardcoded school_id=1
**Prompt:** Multiple files hardcode `school_id=1`: `celery_app.py` beat schedule, `api/webhooks/twilio.py` inbound handler, `workers/inbound.py`. For multi-school support and to prevent data leakage between tenants, resolve `school_id` dynamically from the guardian's school or the Twilio receiving number. Test: create two schools, send an inbound SMS from a guardian in school 2, verify the message is associated with school 2.

### S6. CORS Configuration for Admin API
**Prompt:** The FastAPI app has no CORS middleware. If the dashboard is served from a different origin, browsers block requests. Add `CORSMiddleware` with configurable allowed origins (default: localhost only for dev, explicit list for prod). Test: send a preflight `OPTIONS` request with an `Origin` header, verify `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is returned.

### S7. Transactional Audit Logging
**Prompt:** `infra/audit_logger.py::log_audit_event()` opens its own session and commits independently. If the calling transaction rolls back, the audit event is still committed — breaking causal consistency. Refactor to accept an optional `session` parameter: if provided, insert into that session (same transaction); if not, fall back to standalone. Test: insert an audit event in a session, rollback the session, verify the event is NOT in the database.

### S8. TLS Enforcement for API in Production
**Prompt:** `docker-compose.yml` exposes port 8000 on 0.0.0.0 without TLS. In production, SMS webhook signatures and admin tokens travel in plaintext. Add a production docker-compose override that mounts TLS certificates and runs uvicorn with `--ssl-keyfile` and `--ssl-certfile`. Add a startup check: if `app_env=production` and no TLS config, log a warning. Test: verify production compose file includes SSL flags.

### S9. Phone Number Validation on Inbound
**Prompt:** `Guardian.phone` is stored as `String(20)` with no format validation beyond E.164 comments. Inbound webhooks accept any `From` value. Add validation: reject phone numbers that don't match `^\+?[1-9]\d{1,14}$` (E.164). Log rejected attempts as potential spoofing. Test: send a webhook with `From=invalid`, verify 400 response and audit log entry.

### S10. PII Masking in Error Messages and Tracebacks
**Prompt:** Exception handlers in workers and webhooks catch errors and append `str(exc)` to results/logs. If a SQLAlchemy error includes a phone number or name in the message, PII leaks to logs. Wrap all exception logging with `mask_phone()` and `mask_name()` on the error string. Add a structured logging filter that auto-masks known PII patterns. Test: trigger a DB error containing a phone number, verify the logged message has the number masked.

## Resilience (10)

### R1. Replace asyncio.run() with Persistent Event Loop in Celery Tasks
**Prompt:** Every Celery task uses `asyncio.run()` which creates and destroys an event loop per call — expensive and prevents connection pooling reuse. Create a shared async loop per worker process using `asgiref.sync.async_to_sync` or a module-level loop with `loop.run_until_complete()`. Test: verify two consecutive task calls reuse the same event loop (check `id(asyncio.get_event_loop())` is the same).

### R2. Worker Health Check Endpoint
**Prompt:** Celery workers have no health check — Docker can't detect a zombie worker that's alive but not processing tasks. Add a Celery `inspect`-based health check script that verifies workers respond to ping and have no long-running tasks. Integrate into docker-compose healthcheck. Test: start a worker, run the health check, verify it returns healthy; kill the worker, verify unhealthy.

### R3. Graceful Shutdown for Workers
**Prompt:** When Docker stops a worker, it sends SIGTERM. Celery's default behavior is to abandon in-progress tasks. Add `worker_hijack_root_logger=True`, `task_reject_on_worker_lost=True`, and a SIGTERM handler that finishes the current task before exiting. Set `worker_prefetch_multiplier=1` (already done) so only one task is in-flight. Test: send SIGTERM to a worker mid-task, verify the task completes and the worker exits cleanly.

### R4. Dead Letter Queue for Poison Messages
**Prompt:** If a message fails all retries, it stays in `FAILED` status with no further action. Add a dead letter queue: after `max_retries` exhausted, move the message to a `dead_letter_messages` table (or a Redis list) with the failure reason. Alert staff via the admin dashboard. Test: create a message that always fails, run the worker 4 times, verify it appears in the dead letter queue.

### R5. Quiet Hours Enforcement in Send Worker
**Prompt:** The policy service defines quiet hours, but `workers/sends.py` doesn't check them before sending. Add a quiet-hours check: before claiming a message, load the school's policy; if current time is in quiet hours, defer the message by setting `scheduled_at` to the next allowed time. Test: set quiet hours to encompass the current time, run the send worker, verify no messages are sent and `scheduled_at` is updated.

### R6. Data Retention Purge Job
**Prompt:** The security policy defines retention limits (sent SMS 90 days, failed 30 days, callbacks 30 days, inbound 30 days) but no job enforces them. Add a Celery Beat task that runs daily, deletes records past their retention period, and logs the purge count to audit. Test: insert a message with `created_at` 91 days ago, run the purge, verify it's deleted.

### R7. Circuit Breaker for Twilio API
**Prompt:** If Twilio is down, every send attempt fails, retries, and wastes resources. Implement a circuit breaker: after 5 consecutive failures, stop attempting sends for 60 seconds (OPEN state). After the cooldown, allow one test send (HALF_OPEN). If it succeeds, resume normal operation (CLOSED). Track state in Redis. Test: configure mock adapter to fail 5 times, verify the 6th send is short-circuited with a "circuit open" status.

### R8. Reconciliation Max-Age Cutoff
**Prompt:** `OutboxService.get_unknown_deliveries()` has no max-age limit — it will try to reconcile messages from months ago, wasting API calls. Add an `older_than_minutes` floor AND a `not_older_than_hours` ceiling (default 72 hours). Messages older than 72 hours are marked FAILED with reason `reconciliation_timeout`. Test: create a message with `updated_at` 73 hours ago, run reconciliation, verify it's marked FAILED.

### R9. Failure Threshold Alerting
**Prompt:** There's no alerting when failure rates spike. Add a periodic check (every 15 min): if the failure rate (FAILED / total sent) in the last hour exceeds 20%, log a critical audit event and send an SMS alert to the admin phone number. Test: create 10 messages, 3 failed, run the alert check, verify an alert is generated.

### R10. Automated Database Backup
**Prompt:** The pilot runbook describes manual `pg_dump` but no automated backup. Add a backup sidecar container in docker-compose that runs `pg_dump` nightly, encrypts with `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and stores to a mounted volume. Retain 7 daily + 4 weekly backups. Test: run the backup container, verify a compressed encrypted backup file exists in the volume.
